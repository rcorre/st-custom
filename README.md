This is a customized PKGBUILD for [suckless-st](http://git.suckless.org/st/), a
simple terminal emulator.

It includes a colorscheme patch from
[st-solarized](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/st-essential-patches/),
a scrollback patch from
[st-essential-patches](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/st-essential-patches/),
and a patch to use a version of the font
[Inconsolata](http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html)
which is patched to work with vim-airline.
